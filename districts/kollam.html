The monsoon falls from June to September. The soil is varyingly loamy, laterite and forest at the coastal regions, mainland and the forest areas respectively. The heart land of Kollam is naturally veined by the Ashtamudi lake, a massive, multi-branched water body, which is also a popular boating attraction for tourists. This and the Kollam canal cutting through the city give Kollam a place of prominence in the waterway systems of the country. A number of islands of varying sizes beautifully spot the vast expanse of the lake. The city is graced by beaches where people go to spend quiet evenings. Kollam also has a considerably large forest cover on its eastern side making home for several eco tourism projects like Shenduruni, Thenmala, Palaruvi etc.
<br><br>Kollam City boasts of a long history of political, commercial and cultural importance having found mention in several ancient travellers’ accounts. With a varied colonial past under the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British, Kollam has locations of historical importance like the Thangasseri light house, the St. Thomas Fort and cemetery built by the Portuguese, Thevally Palace, Cheenakkottaram etc. Besides, it also is the site of several old buildings constructed by the Travancore kings (its rulers during the pre-Independence times) in a variety of architectural styles, where many government offices still function. Kollam has been the centre of cashew industry in Kerala from the time of the Portuguese in 16th c. Having hundreds of working cashew factories in the district, Kollam still continues to be the largest processed cashew exporter in India. Neendakara and Thangasseri, the two fishing harbours and ports in Kollam, support a thriving marine industry providing a variety of employment and livelihood to people in large numbers.

<br><br>Kollam city corporation received ISO 9001:2015 certification for municipal administration and services. As per the survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) based on urban area growth during January 2020, Kollam became the tenth fastest growing city in the world with a 31.1% urban growth between 2015 and 2020. It is a coastal city and on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake. The city hosts the administrative offices of Kollam district and is a prominent trading city for the state. The proportion of females to males in Kollam city is second highest among the 500 most populous cities in India.[41] Kollam is one of the least polluted cities in India.
During the later stages of the rule of the Chera monarchy in Kerala, Kollam emerged as the focal point of trade and politics. Kollam continues to be a major business and commercial centre in Kerala. Four major trading centers around Kollam are Kottarakara, Punalur, Paravur, and Karunagapally. Kollam appeared as Palombe in Mandeville's Travels, where he claimed it contained a Fountain of Youth.

        <br> <span> <strong>Kottukkal Cave Temple</strong></span>, also known as Kaltrikkovil in Malayalam, is an existing example of rock cut architecture, built between 6th and 8th centuries CE. It is situated in the village of Kottukkal, near Anchal, Kollam district, Kerala in India. The name Kottukkal (which means Kothiya Kallu- carved rock) is a reference to rock cut shrine. There are two caves of unequal size, both facing the east with the sculpture of the main deity Ganapathy in between.[1] The smaller cave has an idol of Hanuman and the larger one has a monolithic Nandi (bull) in it.[2] Lord Shiva is also a deity in the temple in the form of a Shiva Ling.
        <br><br>According to local traditions, the big rock was brought to the area by the incarnations of Shiva including Nandi to the area, and another small rock near to it called 'chummaadu para' is believed to be the support to relieve the pain when the bigger hard rock kept in head. Historians read its origin back to the 7th century AD when 'Nedila Paranthaka Nedumchadayan' who ruled Chadayamangalam the nearby place, made the rock cut temple. It is now situated in the centre of a large extent of paddy fields and daily rituals are done under Travancore Devaswom Board. The calmness and tranquility of the area attracts the travellers, and one can reach the spot travelling 45 kilometers from Kollam

        <br><br>Arare entity among the temple architecture of Kerala, cave temples is few and arouse great curiosity. The one at Ittiva at Chadayamangalam in Kollam district is one such temple, virtually carved out from a gigantic piece of rock, lying in the middle of a paddy field. From a distance this architectural wonder gives the impression of a sleeping elephant. His rock cut temple represents the vibes of an ancient culture and also the traditional artistic excellence prevalent at that time. The temple known as Kottukal Kal Thrikovil Cave Temple has two square rooms with the main deity of Lord Ganapathy in between. The other deities include Lord Siva in the form of Siva Lingam, Hanuman and Nandikeswara. A Mandapam (roof) in front of one of the rooms stands testimony to the skill of those who build this temple from a single piece of rock. The temple premise also has a well that never dries up.

<br><br>The world’s largest bird sculpture and within it a rock theme park for adventure enthusiasts is what today pays tribute to the mythical bird from the Indian epic Ramayana – Jatayu. Legend has it that Jatayu tried to save Sita (wife of Lord Rama) when Ravana, a demon king, was abducting her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and fallen on these rocks, grievously injured. The Jatayu Adventure Center (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam, 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture, adventure, leisure, and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic that renders the story of Jatayu add to the magic of the destination. A creation of Mr. Rajiv Anchal, this destination is sure to leave each visitor awestruck. The state of the art ropeway offers one a bird’s eye view of God’s Own Country just as the helicopter rides do as well.

 <!-- THANGASSERY LIGHTHOUSE -->

    <p>
        <br><span> <strong>Thangassery</strong></span>is the small town is also famous for its beach, aside from its historical significance. The beach is a 3km stretch of pristine white sands and shallow waves that make it perfect for splashing and swimming. The backdrop of tall swaying coconut trees makes for a relaxing backdrop to the serene, quiet beach. The 3km long breakwater along the beach is a major attraction and a ride along it can improve on the enchantment quotient! Another attraction to the beach is the famous Thangassery Lighthouse, which can be seen rising up majestically above the coconut trees. The cylindrical lighthouse tower is painted in catchy red and white oblique bands. You can bear witness to the glorious sun setting over the Arabian Sea, as well as the rising moon as you drive down on the Lighthouse road. The Thangassery beach Lighthouse was built in 1902 to guide fishermen and sailors along the reef-riddled coastal waters. Its beacon can be seen up to 20km out at sea. History has it that prior to construction of the lighthouse, the British East India Company had installed a tower with an oil lamp. Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops. 

        <br><br>This was later changed to keeping the fire on a raised platform to improve its visibility. It later led to the development of the lighthouse. A lighthouse is a tower designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a navigational aid for maritime piloting. The most famous lighthouse structure was the Pharos of Alexandria; this, however, collapsed during an earthquake. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the number of operational lighthouses has gone down drastically and electronic navigational systems have taken over. Still, the romance of the lighthouse makes it an added attraction as it now beacons to the urbanites. Visitors are allowed to climb to the top of the 140feet high Thangassery lighthouse tower during 10am to 5pm. The tiresome 200steps climb up the spiraling staircase to the top of the tower is more than made up for by the spectacular 360 degrees panoramic view of the Arabian Sea and splendor of the backwaters and Kollam city.

Kollam is easily accessible by train, road or air. Trivandrum International airport is barely 70km away on brisk highways for those coming by flight.
