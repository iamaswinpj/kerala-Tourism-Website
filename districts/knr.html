            <span> <strong>Kannur </strong></span>, formerly known in English as Cannanore, is a city and a municipal corporation in the state of Kerala, India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Kannur district and situated 274 kilometres (170 mi) north of the major port city and commercial hub Kochi and 137 kilometres (85 mi) south of the major port city and a commercial hub, Mangalore. During the period of British colonial rule in India, when Kannur was a part of the Malabar District (Madras Presidency), the city was known as Cannanore. Kannur is the sixth largest urban agglomeration in Kerala. As of 2011 census, Kannur Municipal Corporation, the local body which administers mainland area of city, had a population of 232,486.

            <br><br>Kannur was the headquarters of Kolathunadu, one of the four most important dynasties on the Malabar Coast, along with the Zamorin of Calicut, Kingdom of Cochin and Kingdom of Quilon. The Arakkal kingdom had right over the city of Kannur and Laccadive Islands in the late medieval period.[6] Kannur municipality was formed on 1 November 1866 by the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns Act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, along with the municipalities of Thalassery, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Fort Kochi, making them the first modern municipalities in the state. It was upgraded into a municipal corporation in 2015.

            <span> <strong>St. Angelo Fort</strong></span> (also known as Kannur Fort or Kannur Kotta) is a fort facing the Arabian Sea, situated 3 km from Canannore (Kannur), a city in Kerala state, south India.In 1498, during Vasco da Gama's visit to India, the local Kolathiri king granted the land to Portuguese to build a settlement in present-day Kerala. On 23 October 1505, he gave the Portuguese leader Francisco de Almeida the permission to build a fort at the site. The construction activity began the very next day, on 24 October 1505, when Goncalo Gil Barbosa - the Portuguese factor of Cannanore (Kannur) - laid the foundation stone. The construction of the wooden fort was completed on 30 October 1505: its first Captain was Lourenco Britto, who led a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two ships in the sea. After the fort was completed, Almeida began using the title "Viceroy", and in 1507, he started the construction of a stone fort at the site.
<br><br>The fort was later attacked in vain by the local Indian ruler Zamorin and Kolathiri in the Siege of Cannanore (1507).In August 1509 Almeida, refusing to recognize Afonso de Albuquerque's as the new Portuguese governor to supersede himself, arrested him in this fortress after having fought the naval Battle of Diu. Afonso de Albuquerque was released after six months' confinement, and become governor on the arrival of the grand-marshal of Portugal with a large fleet, in October 1509.

<br><br>The fort provided naval supplies for the Portuguese conquest of Goa and the Portuguese battles against Mamuluk. As the local Portuguese settlement at Kannur had no sources of revenue, the fort's expenses were met with funding from Goa, the seat of Portuguese rule in India.On 15 February 1663, the Dutch captured the fort from the Portuguese. They modernised the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia and Frieslandia that are the major features of the present structure. The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later. A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The Dutch sold the fort to king Ali Raja of Arakkal in 1772. In 1790 the British seized it and used it as their chief military station in Malabar until 1947.

            <span> <strong>Arakkal Museum</strong></span> is a museum dedicated to the Arakkal family, the only Muslim royal family in Kerala, India. The museum is actually a section of the Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Royal Palace). The durbar hall section of the palace has been converted into a museum by the Government of Kerala. It was opened in July 2005 after a Rs. 9,000,000 renovation. The Arakkal Museum is located in Ayikkara, next to the Kannur City. It is located 2-3 kilometres from Kannur town.
            <br><br>Although renovated by the government, the Arakkalkettu is still owned by the Arakkal Royal Trust and does not fall under the control of the country's archaeology department, the Archaeological Survey of India. The government had taken a keen interest in preserving the heritage of the Arakkal Family, which had played a prominent role in the history of Malabar. A nominal entry fee is charged by the Arakkal Royal Trust from visitors to the museum.

        <span> <strong>Sree Peralassery temple</strong></span> is a famous pilgrim centre in the North Malabar region of Kerala, situated at Peralassery in Kannur. The main deity worshipped here is Lord Subramanya. The temple traces its origin to the Thretha Yuga. As per the Ramayana, Lord Sree Rama along with Lakshmana and Hanuman, on their way to Lanka in search of Sita (consort of Sree Rama), reached this place and felt the presence of Lord Subramanya. On approval from Lord Ayyappa, Sree Rama decided to consecrate the idol of Lord Subramanya in this place. He sent Hanuman to the north to find a suitable idol to be installed. When he failed to come at the right time for consecration, Sree Rama removed his Peruvala [great bangle â€“ a symbol of kingdom] and consecrated it. Hence the place got its name Peruvalassery, which in course of time got contracted to Peralassery. Later Hanuman tried to remove the bangle in order to consecrate the idol, but could not do so as he was warned by a serpent.
        <br><br>Located 14 km away from Kannur is the famous pilgrimage site known as Peralassery hosting the holy Sri Subramania temple. The temple is devoted to Lord Subramanya, the son of Lord Shiva and a revered figure in the Hindu religion. The beautiful idol of Lord Subramania in the serpentine form is one of the main tourist attractions. The temple hosts a gorgeous and majestic pond which is a hotbed for tourists every year. The annual Kodiyettam festival is also a hub for cultural and religious buffs. A visit to the temple will leave you exploring recesses of your soul you never knew you had before.
