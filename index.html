Mayyazhi (Mahe / Mahe) is a part of Pondicherry (Puducherry) and lies within Kerala. Though the Lakshadweeps in the Arabian Sea is part of the Union Territories, it has a close alliance with the linguistic and cultural heritage of Kerala. Before the independence of India, Kerala was one of the princely states in india. Later on 1 July 1949, the princely states of Travancore and Cochin united to form the Travancore-Cochin State. <br><br> Later, When the Malabar region (formerly part of Madras state) was added to the Travancore-Cochin State.

The most popular legend on the origin of Kerala says that Kerala rose up from the sea when Lord Parasurama threw his axe into the Sea from Gokarna. Lord Parasurama, believed to be the sixth avatar of Lord Mahavishnu, threw his axe from Gokarna southward across the ocean in rage and in repentance for his actions of killing the kshatriyas and the sea receded upto where his axe had fallen and brought up a narrow strip of land called Kerala.
Geographically Kerala is divided in east- west direction into three parts- Highland, Mid plains and coastal areas. The area in and around the Western Ghats or Sahyadri are mostly hilly and thick evergreen rainforests. The major rivers of Kerala originate from these highlands. Silent Valley in Palakkad district is one of the bio-diversity hotspots in the world. The highest peak in Kerala is Anamudi (2695 m). On the West, the Coastal belt lies parallel to the Western Ghats. In between, the highland and coastal plain lies the mid-lands. It is generally a combination of hills and valleys. The 41 rivers flowing to the Arabian Sea and the lakes in the west, the three eastern flowing rivers, the lakes and backwaters make Kerala a water rich land mass. <br>
